# Farhan Sadeek

Math, Physics and CS Student\
Student Software Engineer

## About Me

Hello, I'm Farhan Sadeek, a student at The Ohio State University. My
passion lies in the dynamic realms of Software Development, Machine
Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. As an active member of the AI
Club and enthusiastic participant in competitive programming, I thrive
on exploring innovative solutions to complex challenges. A dedication to
understanding marks my academic journey the intricacies of computer
science and applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.

## Professional Journey

### Experience

#### Undergraduate Research Assistant

**January 2024 - Present**\
The Ohio State University

I will be working on a research project on the impact of U.S. natural
disasters on individuals with diverse identities, advised by Dr. Kelsea
Best. Using Python (pandas, matplotlib) and R (Tidyverse, ggplot2) for
data visualization, I will attend weekly Zoom meetings to report updates
and deliver presentations.

#### Technical Analyst

**June 2023 - Present**\
Spectrum

I collaboratively resolved complex issues cross-functionally, leveraging
statistical methodologies that led to a 15% improvement in team
satisfaction. Additionally, I demonstrated advanced research knowledge,
consistently exceeding targets and achieving a 10% increase in project
milestones and academic standards through rigorous statistical analysis.

#### Data Analyst

**August 2021 - Present**\
Google AI

I leveraged my expertise in Kaggle datasets to analyze and extract
valuable insights, driving data-driven decision-making and enhancing
business performance. Through developing and implementing advanced
machine learning models and algorithms, I achieved a 20% improvement in
solving complex problems and optimizing business processes.
Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I effectively communicated
findings from Kaggle datasets, enabling stakeholders to make informed
decisions and contributing to a 10% increase in desired outcomes.

#### Data Science Intern

**May 2022 - August 2022**\
Harvard University

Developed Dr. Kane's Harvard Class GOV 1005 with R coding language along
with other student researchers. Four weeks of training under Dr. Kane
culminated in an independent Data Analytics Research Project, where I
analysed the impact of different economic indices on the population of a
country.
